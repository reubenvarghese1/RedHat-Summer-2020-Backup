# RedHat-Summer-2020-Backup

This is a backup of the state of my work after my summer internship. The sole purpose of this repository is for having an easy way to get back to where were left when I return to work. The code in this repo is that of the kmod program. Since this is a work in progress, the code may contain bugs(and the changes are largely untested) and is in no way intended for deployment.
